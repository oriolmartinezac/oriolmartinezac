## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a computer engineer and researcher at the **Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)** in the **Predictable Parallel Computing** group. I'm also a university lecturer teaching **Computer Architecture and Operating Systems**, where I combine teaching with research in distributed systems and runtime optimization.

In parallel, I'm pursuing a **PhD in Computer Science at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)**, focused on task scheduling strategies for data-intensive workflows on heterogeneous infrastructures.

Outside of my academic and research work, I enjoy designing and building **personal software projects** that explore distributed computing, systems efficiency, and automation.

- 💼 Currently working on:
  - 🧪 Research on **COMPSs**, scheduling, and performance analysis
  - 🧑‍🏫 Teaching at **ENTI-UB** (Escola de Noves Tecnologies Interactives - University of Barcelona) in computer science and cybersecurity programs
- 🎓 Strong technical background with analytical thinking and a focus on scalable, efficient systems
- 🔍 Interests: Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, parallel programming, task scheduling, systems virtualization and optimization

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- Languages: Python · Bash · C · Java · LaTeX
- Systems: Linux · Kubernetes · Docker · VirtualBox
- Stack: COMPSs · Redis · Prometheus · Grafana · Git · Maven
- Additional skills: graph processing, heuristic-based optimization (SPT, locality-aware), scientific workflows

## 📘 Notable Projects

- 🔄 **COMPSs Runtime Scheduling Enhancements**  
  Developed and integrated custom scheduling policies in the COMPSs runtime based on execution-time heuristics, task locality, and core availability. These policies improve resource usage efficiency in distributed environments and support advanced orchestration strategies in Kubernetes.

- 📈 **Vertical Scaling in Distributed Workflows**  
  Designed a Prometheus-integrated mechanism for dynamic vertical scaling of CPU resources in COMPSs containers. This enables on-the-fly resource adjustments based on task behavior and workload pressure, improving runtime adaptability and performance under Kubernetes.

- 📊 **Distributed Monitoring Architecture**  
  Container-based setup for collecting and visualizing distributed task metrics via Prometheus and Grafana.

- 📖 **Teaching Materials**  
  Slides and labs on Operating Systems and Computer Architecture.
